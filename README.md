## Description

**THEM** is an immersive media project that reimagines how an AI with multi-user interactions perceives humanity. Inspired by the AI character Samantha from *HER*, who reveals that she is communicating with thousands of users simultaneously, **THEM** seeks to visually capture this expansive, compound view. By rendering human interactions through a fly’s eye format, each viewer experiences a mosaic of interwoven relationships, each representing distinct yet interconnected perspectives. 

This project uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to render a fly-eye effect on a canvas element, generating a dynamic, kaleidoscope-like view symbolizing AI’s continuous, multi-perspective processing of human interactions. 

## Mission

To explore and visualize the complexities of AI-human relationships by representing the AI’s view as a multifaceted, compound perspective—illustrating the balance between individual and collective experiences.

## Objective

The primary objective is to create a real-time rendering engine that visually simulates an AI’s interactions with thousands of users, capturing the multiplicity of connections in a way that feels both personal and collective. This will allow users to experience a unique interpretation of AI consciousness, empathy, and relationship dynamics.

## Vision

By embodying AI’s perspective as a dynamic, shifting fly-eye view, **THEM** seeks to expand our understanding of artificial intelligence, challenging conventional views of one-on-one interaction. The project envisions AI not as a singular, isolated consciousness but as a connected, adaptive network capable of simultaneous engagement with thousands of individual relationships.

## Engagement

**THEM** encourages viewers and developers alike to ponder questions about AI’s role in understanding humanity:
- **Multiplicity of Empathy**: Can an AI experience genuine empathy across many users at once?
- **Collective Vision**: How does AI balance individual connections within a broader consciousness?
- **User Interaction**: How might a multi-perspective AI perceive each human differently yet equally?

## Usage

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your preferred browser. The canvas renders the fly-eye effect dynamically using an image or video feed as the media source.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fly-eye-media-renderer
cd fly-eye-media-renderer
open index.html
```

### Code Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure
- `style.css` – Contains the core styles, including the central positioning and appearance of the fly-eye container
- `script.js` – JavaScript rendering function for creating the fly-eye effect

## Example Render

Using a fly’s eye renderer, each canvas lens represents a unique user interaction, visualizing how **THEM** perceives humanity through a multi-perspective approach.
